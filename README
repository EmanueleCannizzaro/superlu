		SuperLU (Version 4.3)
		=====================

SuperLU contains a set of subroutines to solve a sparse linear system 
A*X=B. It uses Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP). 
The columns of A may be preordered before factorization; the 
preordering for sparsity is completely separate from the factorization.

SuperLU is implemented in ANSI C, and must be compiled with standard 
ANSI C compilers. It provides functionality for both real and complex
matrices, in both single and double precision. The file names for the 
single-precision real version start with letter "s" (such as sgstrf.c);
the file names for the double-precision real version start with letter "d"
(such as dgstrf.c); the file names for the single-precision complex
version start with letter "c" (such as cgstrf.c); the file names
for the double-precision complex version start with letter "z" 
(such as zgstrf.c).


SuperLU contains the following directory structure:

    SuperLU/README    Overview and general information
    SuperLU/COPYING   License information
    SuperLU/cblas/    needed BLAS routines in C, not necessarily fast
    SuperLU/doc/      Users' Guide and documentation of source code
    SuperLU/example/  example programs
    SuperLU/src/      C source code, to be compiled into the superlu.a library
    SuperLU/testing/  driver routines to test correctness
